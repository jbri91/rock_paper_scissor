# Summary
This project made a lot of things click for me. I was having a hard time understanding the dot syntax as well as working with the DOM. Because of that, I was actually able to complete this project a little faster than expected. Speed is definitely not the goal as much as quality is for me but it was a great feeling to have the ah ha moments trickling in.

As I became more familiar with creating if/else statements, I wanted to play around with the font color to change in different circumstances. This project also let me practiced grabbing elements from the DOM to change them.
